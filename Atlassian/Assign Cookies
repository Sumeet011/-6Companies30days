Question : Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], 
we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Solution : class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        int L1 = s.size() - 1;
        int L2 = g.size() - 1;
        int ans = 0;
        while (L1 >= 0 && L2 >= 0) {
            if (s[L1] >= g[L2]) {
                ans++;
                L1--;
                L2--;
            } else {
                L2--;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
