Question : Repeated DNA Sequences
Difficulty : Medium

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.
For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
You may return the answer in any order.

Solution : 
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        deque<char> dq;
        unordered_map<string, int> M;
        vector<string> result;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            dq.push_back(s[i]); 
            
            if (dq.size() > 10) {
                dq.pop_front();  
            }

            if (dq.size() == 10) {  
                string sequence(dq.begin(), dq.end());
                M[sequence]++;  
            }
        }

        for (auto& entry : M) {
            if (entry.second > 1) {
                result.push_back(entry.first);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
