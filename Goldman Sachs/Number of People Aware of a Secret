Question : Number of People Aware of a Secret

Descriptio : On day 1, one person discovers a secret.
You are given an integer delay, which means that each person will share the secret with a new person every day, starting from delay days after discovering the secret. You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.
Given an integer n, return the number of people who know the secret at the end of day n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Solution : 
class Solution {
public:
    long dp[1001];
    long m=1e9+7;
    int peopleAwareOfSecret(int n, int delay, int forget) {
        memset(dp,-1,sizeof(dp));
        return helper(1,n,delay,forget);
    }
    long helper(int day,int &n,int &delay,int &forget){
        // some people know the secret on this day
        if(dp[day]!=-1)
            return dp[day];
        long ans=0;
        // he is the one who knows the secret so do ans++
        ans++;
        // but if till the end of nth day he forgets the secret then do we have to add this to answer?  No
        if(day+forget<=n)
            ans--;
        // now on what days he can tell the secret?   that is from day+delay to min(day+forget,n+1)-1
        for(int start=day+delay;start<(min(day+forget,n+1));start++){
            ans+=helper(start,n,delay,forget);
            ans%=m;
        }
        // store it in dp
        dp[day]=ans;
        return ans;
        
    }
};
