Question : Friends Of Appropriate Ages

Descrption : There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.
A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:
age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
age[y] > age[x]
age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100
Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.
Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.
Return the total number of friend requests made.

Solution : class Solution {
public:
    int numFriendRequests(vector<int>& ages) {
        vector<int> M(121, 0);  // M[i] will store the count of people of age i (range 0-120)
        
        for (int a : ages) {
            M[a]++;
        }

        int ANS = 0;

        for (int a : ages) {
            int X = 0.5 * a + 7;  
            for (int i = 1; i < 121; i++) {
                // Check the conditions for sending a friend request
                if (i > X && i <= a && (i <= 100 || a >= 100)) {
                    ANS += M[i];  // Add the frequency of valid recipients of age 'i'
                    if(i==a) ANS--;
                }
            }
        }

        return ANS;
    }
};
